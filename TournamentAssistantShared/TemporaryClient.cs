/**
 * Created by Moon on 9/12/2020, 1:41AM.
 * This is a very simple extension of a standard SystemClient,
 * with the addition of an event which provides packets as they
 * are received. This is useful for temporary clients (HostScraper)
 * so they can perform one simple action, wait for a reaction, then
 * disconnect. Should not be used for other purposes, use a SystemClient
 * for more robust clients, use a Client directly for more simple ones.
