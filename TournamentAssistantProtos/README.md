# TournamentAssistantProtos
Proto models for TournamentAssistant

Be sure to download and install protoc from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.19.4), and be sure it is in your PATH, then you may run the sample scripts on windows. They may need tweaking for other operating systems.

The TypeScript sample will require you to have node/npm installed and to run `npm install` in the scripts folder before running the build script.
